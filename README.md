## SoftDevelop
A shell script that installs software developments tools. I created this tool because I was bored and needed something to automate my installations. What a great way to build software to do this.

### Installation
You have to clone this repo first by: `git clone https://github.com/wymillerlinux/SoftDevelop` <br>
Then navigate to the directory that the repo was cloned to.

### Running
This works on multiple shells. <br>
Bash: `bash softwaredevel.sh` <br>
Fish (I use this shell): `fish softwaredevel.sh` <br>
Zsh: `zsh softwaredevel.sh` <br>

### Troubleshooting

Q: I don't want `fish` <br>
A: Cool, totally respect your shells. To get rid of it, use: `chsh -s /path/to/shell` and tada!<br>
Your shell will change on your next login. Type: `man chsh` for more details.

Q: I don't like the software you put in here! <br>
A: Cool, don't care, however. This is MY installation script and I want to share this with developers.

Q: I wanna help! Where can I start? <br>
A: Awesome! I suck at shell scripting. You can modify the logic and the structure in my script but you can't modify any of the packages I need for development. Just heads up.
